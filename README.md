## Plan your run with this super awesome app :)

Features:
- calculate distance / time / speed & tempo without page reload
- for distance, you can use standard values such as marathon and half marathon
- divide your run into segments - be honest with yourself, you won't make it full speed the whole run! ;)
	- fun fact - did you know, that if first 10km you plan to run with speed 10km/h and the second 10km with 12km/h, than the average on those 20km will not be 11km/h? :)
- change order of segments easily, if you have a second thought about your strategy
- or just easily reset / remove wrong segments
- get a full summary of the plan and share it via whatsapp, FB, mail or just copy the link - in case someone needs to know what are your plans :)
- switch language between English and Polish
- switch between light and dark theme
- both above are locally stored in your browser
- add this app to your mobile screen - basic PWA is added (offline not yet available, but you will have a simple and inelegant icon on your screen ;))
- more to come!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

  

## Available Scripts

  

In the project directory, you can run:

  

### `yarn start`

  

Runs the app in the development mode.<br  />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  

The page will reload if you make edits.<br  />

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

  

### `yarn test`

  

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br  />

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  

### `yarn build`

  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br  />

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br  />

Your app is ready to be deployed!

  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

  

### `yarn eject`

  

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

  

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

  

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

  

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
